Joyjet Webdesign Test made with React.

## Setup

Clone the project and run `npm install` at the project root, then you're good to go! After the script is done with the installation, proceed to the **Available Scripts** and **Documentation** for more info on what you can do now.

## Available Scripts

After installing the modules, in the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

# Documentation

The project documentation is made using [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).

1. Run the command `npm run storybook` and wait for the localhost browser window to open.
